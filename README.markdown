**WARNING:** This is a test repo and may be deleted at any time.

If youâ€™re looking for stability, you should track the official SVN
repository at <http://fusionpbx.googlecode.com/svn>.

The [vendor branch](http://github.com/bfritz/fusionpbx/tree/vendor)
is a git-svn clone of upstream without local changes.  The
[master branch](http://github.com/bfritz/fusionpbx/tree/master) is
where I will publish most of my local changes.
